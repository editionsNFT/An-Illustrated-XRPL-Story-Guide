# An Illustrated XRPL Story Guide

This is a story in the making. A story under development.
The plan is to interview projects that are developing on the XRPL and incorporate key lesson learned that they encountered into the guide via an illustrated story.  
The layout, content, story flow and illustrations are still to be determined.  An initial suggested chapter outline is proposed below, but this will change, depending on our findings.
